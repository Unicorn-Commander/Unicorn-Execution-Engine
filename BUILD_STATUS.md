# Build Status - July 6, 2025

## üéØ **Primary Goal: Build MLIR-AIE Kernels for NPU Acceleration**

This document tracks the real-time status of the effort to compile and build the necessary components for enabling hardware acceleration on the AMD Phoenix NPU.

## üö® **CURRENT STATUS: BLOCKED** üö®

**Issue:** The `mlir-aie` project build is failing consistently.

**Location of Failure:** The build fails during the `cmake` configuration step for the `mlir-aie` project, specifically when attempting to resolve dependencies related to Python modules and testing infrastructure.

**Root Cause:** The `mlir-aie` project's internal CMake configuration appears to be misconfigured, leading to errors where it cannot find targets like `AIEPythonModules`, `FileCheck`, `count`, and `not`, even when attempts are made to enable or disable them.

**Attempts to Fix:**
*   **Initial `requirements.txt` fix:** Handled missing `requirements.txt` file.
*   **Explicit `MLIR_DIR` and `LLVM_DIR`:** Attempted to provide explicit paths to LLVM/MLIR installations.
*   **`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` for LLVM:** Modified LLVM build to install to a known prefix.
*   **`LLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=ON`:** Attempted to build LLVM test utilities.
*   **`DBUILD_TESTING=OFF` for `mlir-aie`:** Attempted to disable `mlir-aie` tests to bypass dependency issues.
*   **Using `mlir-aie`'s `utils` scripts:** Leveraged `mlir-aie/utils/clone-llvm.sh` and `mlir-aie/utils/build-llvm.sh` for dependency management.
*   **Explicit `make AIEPythonModules`:** Attempted to force build the `AIEPythonModules` target.
*   **Simplified `build_mlir_aie.sh` script:** Created a minimal script to isolate the `mlir-aie` build process.

**Conclusion:** The issue appears to be deeply rooted within the `mlir-aie` project's CMake configuration, which is beyond the scope of direct modification or debugging within the current environment. Further attempts to fix this via script modifications are unlikely to be successful.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Next Steps (Requires External Action)**

To resolve this, manual inspection and potential modification of the `mlir-aie` project's CMake files (e.g., `CMakeLists.txt` within the `mlir-aie` directory and its subdirectories) may be necessary. This would involve understanding how `AIEPythonModules` and testing targets are defined and linked within their build system. Seeking support from the `mlir-aie` community or documentation might also be beneficial.
