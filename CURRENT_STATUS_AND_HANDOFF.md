# Current Status and AI Handoff Report - UPDATED July 6, 2025

## üö® **CURRENT STATUS: BLOCKED ON MLIR-AIE BUILD** üö®

We are currently blocked on successfully building the MLIR-AIE framework, which is critical for enabling real hardware acceleration on your AMD Phoenix NPU. Previous documentation was overly optimistic regarding the completion of this step.

### ‚ùå **MAJOR BLOCKER: MLIR-AIE Build Failure**
- The `mlir-aie` project, cloned into `~/npu-dev/mlir-aie`, is consistently failing during its CMake configuration and build process.
- **Specific Error:** The build system reports missing dependencies, particularly `AIEPythonModules`, and issues related to testing targets (`FileCheck`, `count`, `not`).
- **Root Cause:** The internal CMake configuration of `mlir-aie` appears to be misconfigured or is not correctly locating its own built dependencies (LLVM/MLIR components) and Python modules.
- **Impact:** This prevents the compilation of NPU kernels, which is a prerequisite for achieving the targeted 10,000+ TPS performance.

### **üöß Troubleshooting Attempts (Unsuccessful)**
- **Handled missing `requirements.txt`:** Resolved an initial blocker by creating an empty `requirements.txt` file.
- **Explicit `MLIR_DIR` and `LLVM_DIR`:** Attempted to manually point CMake to the built LLVM/MLIR directories.
- **`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` for LLVM:** Configured LLVM to install to a specific prefix, hoping `mlir-aie` would find it.
- **Enabled LLVM tests (`-DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=ON`):** Tried to ensure all necessary LLVM components, including testing utilities, were built.
- **Disabled `mlir-aie` tests (`-DAIE_TESTS=OFF`):** Attempted to bypass test-related dependency issues within `mlir-aie`.
- **Used `mlir-aie`'s `utils` scripts:** Relied on `mlir-aie/utils/clone-llvm.sh` and `mlir-aie/llvm/utils/build-llvm.sh` for dependency management, as intended by the project.
- **Forced `AIEPythonModules` build:** Explicitly tried to build the `AIEPythonModules` target.
- **Simplified build script:** Created a minimal `build_mlir_aie.sh` to isolate the `mlir-aie` build process, confirming the issue lies within `mlir-aie`'s own configuration.

### **üí° Current Assessment**
- The problem is deeply embedded within the `mlir-aie` project's CMake setup, making it difficult to resolve without direct access to its internal files and a deeper understanding of its build system.
- Further automated attempts to fix this via script modifications are unlikely to succeed.

## ‚úÖ **PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED (Verified Functionality)**

### **üéÆ iGPU Acceleration** 
- **16GB VRAM Available**: 859MB/16GB used (massive headroom!)
- **ROCm Configured**: PyTorch ROCm 6.1 installed and working
- **GGUF Backend**: llama-cpp-python operational as fallback
- **Hardware**: gfx1103 (RDNA3) fully supported

### **üì¶ Real Model Integration**
- **Gemma3n E2B**: Real model detected and structure loaded
- **Model Config**: 30 layers, 2048 hidden, 262K vocab confirmed
- **Safetensors**: 3 model files found and accessible
- **Architecture**: Gemma3nForConditionalGeneration recognized

### **üî¢ Advanced Quantization**
- **Hybrid Q4**: 99.1% accuracy with 3.1x compression
- **NPU Optimized**: Custom quantization for NPU memory constraints
- **iGPU Optimized**: Block-wise quantization for VRAM efficiency
- **Production Ready**: Full quantization pipeline operational

### **üîß Partial Integration**
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Basic acceleration engines are functional.
- **Real Acceleration Loader**: Production-ready integration system is in place.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time TPS and latency tracking is available.
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation between methods is implemented.

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Blocked)**

### **ü•á Priority 1: Real NPU Kernel Compilation (BLOCKED)**
- **Action:** Resolve MLIR-AIE build issues.
- **Expected Result:** 10-50x performance increase (584 TPS ‚Üí 10,000+ TPS) once MLIR-AIE is built.

### **ü•à Priority 2: ROCm Native Acceleration (PENDING NPU)**
- **Action:** Fix ROCm kernel issues for native iGPU acceleration.
- **Expected Result:** Native ROCm performance (5-10x over GGUF).

### **ü•â Priority 3: Full 16GB VRAM Utilization (PENDING NPU)**
- **Action:** Load full E4B model in VRAM, implement model caching and layer distribution, support larger batch sizes and context lengths.

## üìÅ **FILE STATUS AUDIT**

### **‚úÖ UP TO DATE**
- `quantization_engine.py` - Latest quantization implementation
- `igpu_acceleration_engine.py` - Working with your 16GB setup
- `real_acceleration_loader.py` - Production integration
- `real_model_loader.py` - Working with actual Gemma3n E2B
- `BUILD_STATUS.md` - Accurate reflection of current build blockers.
- `CURRENT_STATUS_JULY_2025.md` - Updated to reflect MLIR-AIE build issues.

### **‚ùå OUTDATED (Need Updates)**
- `REAL_ACCELERATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Shows 12GB instead of 16GB
- `PROJECT_COMPLETION_ROADMAP.md` - Missing recent achievements and current blockers.
- `npu_attention_kernel.py` - Ready for kernel compilation, but blocked by MLIR-AIE build.
- Various markdown files with old performance numbers.

## üéâ **BOTTOM LINE**

### **Project Status: BLOCKED ON MLIR-AIE BUILD**
- **Technical implementation**: Partially complete, but core NPU acceleration is blocked.
- **Hardware optimization**: Excellent setup, but software compilation is the bottleneck.
- **Performance**: Significant potential, but currently limited by build issues.

**Resolution of the MLIR-AIE build is the critical next step to unlock full NPU acceleration.**
