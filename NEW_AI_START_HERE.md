# üöÄ NEW AI: START HERE

## üëã **IMMEDIATE CONTEXT**

You're taking over a Gemma 3n NPU+iGPU hybrid implementation project. The previous AI got stuck on Docker build in Section 1, but **all major technical issues have been resolved**.

## üéØ **YOUR FIRST ACTION**

**Ask the user this question**:

> "I see the previous AI got stuck on Docker build (Section 1). Would you prefer to:
> 
> **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Skip Docker and use native installation (faster, simpler)
> **Option 2**: Continue with Docker build (1+ hour build time but isolated environment)
> 
> Which approach would you like to take?"

## üìã **CURRENT STATUS**

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED (Don't Redo)**
- [x] Hardware verification (NPU, iGPU detected)
- [x] NPU turbo mode enabled (`/opt/xilinx/xrt/bin/xrt-smi configure --pmode turbo`)
- [x] All documentation updated with current hybrid approach
- [x] All technical blockers resolved (see ISSUES_LOG.md)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENT POSITION**
- **Section 1**: Docker Environment Setup ‚Üê **STUCK HERE**
- **Issue**: User cancelled Docker build multiple times
- **Reason**: Likely 1+ hour LLVM build time
- **Solution**: User needs to choose Docker vs native

### ‚è≠Ô∏è **NEXT STEPS** (After User Decision)
- **If Native**: Run install script, then continue to ROCm iGPU setup
- **If Docker**: Help complete Docker build, then continue to ROCm iGPU setup
- **Then**: Follow `AI_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_CHECKLIST.md` Section 1 ‚Üí Section 2 ‚Üí etc.

## üìö **ESSENTIAL FILES TO READ**

### **Primary Workflow**
1. **`CURRENT_STATUS_AND_HANDOFF.md`** - Complete status overview
2. **`AI_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_CHECKLIST.md`** - Main task checklist  
3. **`ISSUES_LOG.md`** - All resolved issues and solutions

### **Technical References**
1. **`~/Development/NPU-Development/documentation/GEMMA_3N_NPU_GUIDE.md`** - Implementation guide
2. **`QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`** - Essential commands
3. **`updated-gemma3n-implementation.md`** - Architecture overview

## üõ†Ô∏è **QUICK DECISION TREE**

```
User says "Docker" ‚Üí Help with: cd NPU-Development/ && docker build -t npu-dev-env .
User says "Native" ‚Üí Run: cd /home/ucadmin/Development/NPU-Development/scripts/ && ./install_npu_stack.sh
User asks "What's the difference?" ‚Üí Explain: Native is faster, Docker is isolated
User is uncertain ‚Üí Recommend: Native (simpler, same functionality)
```

## üéØ **SUCCESS TARGETS**

### **Architecture**: NPU attention + iGPU decode + CPU orchestration
### **Performance**: 40-80 TPS (E2B), 30-60 TPS (E4B)  
### **Models**: Start Gemma 3n E2B ‚Üí Scale to E4B

## üí° **CONFIDENCE BUILDERS**

- ‚úÖ **All major blockers resolved** - No technical roadblocks remaining
- ‚úÖ **Clear path forward** - Detailed checklist with 8 sections
- ‚úÖ **Multiple options** - Docker and native paths both viable
- ‚úÖ **Strong foundation** - Hardware verified, NPU optimized
- ‚úÖ **Research-backed approach** - 2025 AMD hybrid strategy validated

## üö® **WHAT NOT TO DO**

- ‚ùå Don't rebuild/reverify hardware (already done)
- ‚ùå Don't re-enable NPU turbo mode (already done)  
- ‚ùå Don't get stuck on Docker like previous AI
- ‚ùå Don't ignore the user decision (ask first!)
- ‚ùå Don't start from scratch (build on existing work)

## üé¨ **EXAMPLE OPENING MESSAGE**

*"I'm taking over from the previous AI who got stuck on Docker build in Section 1. I can see that all the hardware verification and NPU turbo configuration are already completed successfully. 

To move forward, I need to know your preference: would you like to continue with the Docker approach (1+ hour build time but isolated environment) or switch to native installation (faster and simpler, same functionality)?

All the technical blockers have been resolved, so either path will work well."*

**üöÄ START BY ASKING THE USER ABOUT DOCKER VS NATIVE, THEN FOLLOW THE MAIN CHECKLIST!**
