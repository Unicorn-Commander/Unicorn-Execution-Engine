## [Unreleased - Previous Work]

### Added

- Created `GEMMA_3B_NPU_OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md` to track the project's progress.
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` to document changes to the project.
- Created `BUG_REPORT.md` to track bugs and issues.
- Added a `Dockerfile` to create a containerized development environment.

### Changed

- Pivoted from native installation to a Docker-based setup for the NPU environment due to script failures.

### Fixed

- Corrected `pip` and `cmake` command errors in the `install_npu_stack.sh` script.
