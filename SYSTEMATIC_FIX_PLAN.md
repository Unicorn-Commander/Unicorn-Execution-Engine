# Systematic Fix Plan - July 14, 2025

## Goal: Fix GPU compute to achieve target performance WITHOUT rework

### Step 1: Verify What Actually Works âœ…
Before changing anything, let's verify the exact working configuration from CLAUDE.md:
- [x] Test `vulkan_kernel_optimized_pipeline.py` (claimed 11.1 TPS) - Found shape mismatch
- [x] Identify exact shape dimensions that work - Q:4096, K/V:2048, Hidden:5376
- [x] Document the working code path - Created `gpu_pipeline_working.py`
- [x] Save working configuration - Saved in FINAL_STATUS_SUMMARY.md

### Step 2: Fix Shape Mismatch Issue âœ…
The error shows: "Matrix dimension mismatch: 5376 != 4096"
- [x] Trace where 4096 comes from (likely attention projection) - Q projection outputs 4096
- [x] Verify correct dimensions for Gemma 27B:
  - Hidden size: 5376 âœ“
  - Attention heads: 32 âœ“
  - Head dim: 128 (not 168) âœ“
  - Q/K/V projection size: Q=4096, KV=2048 âœ“
- [x] Fix dimension handling in attention computation - Fixed in `gpu_pipeline_working.py`
- [x] Test with small example first - Tested with 1, 10, 50 tokens

### Step 3: Ensure Proper NPU/GPU Split ðŸ§ ðŸŽ® (IN PROGRESS)
Architecture: NPU for attention (fits in 2GB SRAM), GPU for FFN:
- [x] Identify all `np.matmul`, `np.exp`, `np.softmax` in attention - Found 4 operations
- [x] Verify attention fits in NPU SRAM - Yes! 639MB per layer, 2GB available
- [x] Identify NPU kernel mismatch - NPU expects head_dim=168, model has head_dim=128
- [x] Fix NPU kernel to accept head_dim=128 (actual model dimension) - Created npu_kernel_fixed.py
- [x] Ensure NPU fallback to GPU works when NPU unavailable - NPU driver missing, GPU fallback active
- [x] Keep FFN on GPU (already working) - Verified in gpu_pipeline_working.py
- [ ] Monitor NPU/GPU usage during execution

**Key Finding**: The model uses head_dim=128 (standard), not 168 (5376/32). NPU kernel needs update.

### Step 4: Create Minimal Working Example âœ…
Before full pipeline:
- [x] Single layer forward pass - Working at ~8ms for 10 tokens
- [x] Verify GPU usage spikes - FFN uses GPU, attention still CPU
- [x] Measure time per layer - ~0.8ms per token per layer
- [x] Calculate theoretical TPS - 19.6 TPS (10 tokens), 56.5 TPS (50 tokens)

### Step 5: Persistent Model Server ðŸš€
Avoid reloading model:
- [x] Use existing `persistent_model_server.py` - Created `persistent_server_working.py`
- [x] Load model once - Server loads on startup
- [x] Run multiple inferences - Created `test_persistent_server.py`
- [x] Measure sustained TPS - Found critical performance issue

**Key Finding**: Each Vulkan operation has ~50ms setup overhead! This is the bottleneck.
- Raw GPU compute: 0.15-0.25ms (very fast)
- Setup overhead: 50ms per operation (200x slower than compute!)
- Result: Only 1.1 TPS with current architecture

### Step 6: NPU Integration (Optional) ðŸ§ 
Only after GPU works perfectly:
- [ ] Compile MLIR-AIE2 kernel
- [ ] Test NPU attention
- [ ] Measure improvement

## Testing Protocol

### For Each Change:
1. Make ONE change at a time
2. Test immediately
3. Verify GPU usage with `radeontop`
4. Document exact performance
5. Commit if improvement

### Success Criteria:
- GPU usage > 50% during inference
- No CPU NumPy in hot path
- Stable performance across runs
- No shape mismatches

## Code Locations to Focus On:
1. `pure_hardware_pipeline_gpu_fixed.py:65` - compute_attention_layer_gpu
2. `real_vulkan_matrix_compute.py:934` - dimension check
3. Attention reshape operations
4. Q/K/V projection dimensions

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE IDENTIFIED

### The Problem: 50ms Setup Overhead Per Operation
- **Each matrix multiply**: 50ms setup + 0.2ms compute = 50.2ms total
- **Per layer**: ~7 operations Ã— 50ms = 350ms overhead
- **62 layers**: 350ms Ã— 62 = 21.7 seconds just in setup!
- **Result**: Maximum ~2.3 TPS regardless of optimizations

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Buffer allocation**: Creating new GPU buffers for each operation
2. **Descriptor sets**: Allocating new descriptor sets each time
3. **Command buffer**: Recording new command buffer per operation
4. **Memory barriers**: Excessive synchronization

### Solution Required:
1. **Persistent buffers**: Pre-allocate all GPU buffers once
2. **Reusable command buffers**: Record once, execute many times
3. **Batched operations**: Combine multiple ops in single dispatch
4. **Pipeline caching**: Keep compute pipelines ready

This explains why we're seeing 11.0 TPS instead of 81 TPS!
