  🎯 Performance Targets

  | Optimization Level    | Target Tokens/Sec | Time Per Token |
  |-----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
  | Current (Baseline)    | 0.005             | 197 seconds    |
  | After High Priority   | 0.5 - 1.0         | 1-2 seconds    |
  | After Medium Priority | 2.0 - 5.0         | 200-500ms      |
  | Production Ready      | 10+               | <100ms         |

  🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Recommended Order)
