# Gemini AI - Changelog (July 8, 2025)

This document tracks the file modifications made by the Gemini AI assistant.

## `measure_real_performance.py`

*   **Modified:** The script was updated to utilize the `IntegratedQuantizedNPUEngine` for loading and testing the `gemma-3-27b-it` model.
*   **Reasoning:** This change was made to bypass a persistent `TypeError` in the original `test_real_npu_igpu_performance.py` script, which was caused by an issue with the `device_map` configuration. The new approach provides a more robust and accurate method for measuring the engine's performance with the target model.
